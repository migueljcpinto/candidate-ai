# Welcome to AI Candidate

This is a project that seeks to utilize artificial intelligence to create chatbots simulating conversations of political candidates for the legislative elections in Portugal. This project aims primarily to explore and learn about chatbot development and applications of "memory" using artificial intelligence and data bases, offering a unique experience.

It is important to note that all chatbots have been trained with limited and outdated information. This project does not aim to provide accurate or updated data about the candidates or the elections in question. Therefore, we recommend that you always verify the accuracy of the information provided by the chatbots and consult the Political Programs of each Party for more precise information.

## Remember:

Content may not be up to date.
Information from the chatbots is NOT real.
Don't take anything seriously! Inform yourself!
